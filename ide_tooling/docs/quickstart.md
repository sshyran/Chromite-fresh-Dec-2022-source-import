# CrOS IDE quickstart (go/cros-ide-quickstart)

CrOS IDE is a VS Code Extension for Chrome OS development. It is a new project,
and we currently support only internal developers at Google.

## Prerequisites

All you need is a Chrome OS chroot, which most developers already have.
If you don't have it, please follow the [Chromium OS Developer Guide] and set up
your development environment, so you can [enter the chroot via cros_sdk].

[Chromium OS Developer Guide]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/developer_guide.md
[enter the chroot via cros_sdk]: https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/docs/+/HEAD/developer_guide.md#Enter-the-chroot

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code

First, you need to install Visual Studio on your client machine.

### gLinux
```
sudo apt install code
```
Learn more at [go/vscode/install#glinux]

[go/vscode/install#glinux]: http://go/vscode/install#glinux

### gMac
Install [VS Code from the Software Center] or [go/mule]
(`sudo mule install visual-studio-code`).

[VS Code from the Software Center]: https://device-portal.corp.google.com/#/software-center/list//appid%3AMAC_OS-visual-studio-code/MAC_OS
[go/mule]: http://go/mule

### Chrome OS

CrOS IDE supports only platform-specific VS Code, which is not available for
Chrome OS. There are two workarounds:
- Check out [go/cros-ide-on-chromebooks] to learn more about
  [Code Server], which is a Web IDE accessible in the browser.
- Use remote desktop.

[Code Server]: https://github.com/coder/code-server

## 2. Install cros-sdk-proxy

Follow [cros-sdk-proxy documentation](../cros-sdk-proxy/README.md).

Verify the installation by running the following command on your client machine:
```
ssh cros
```
It should connect to the chroot, just like `cros_sdk` does.

## 3. Connect to chroot via VSCode

Install [Remote development] extension on the VSCode.
Select SSH target `cros` and open your working directory under
`/home/$USER/chromiumos/`.

[Remote development]: https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack

## 4. Install the extension

Open terminal in the VSCode connected to `cros`, and run

```
~/chromiumos/chromite/ide_tooling/cros-ide/install.sh
```

### Additional installation options

* In case you are using code-server or VS Code Insiders, specify the VS Code executable with
  `--exe` flag. For example

```
~/chromiumos/chromite/ide_tooling/cros-ide/install.sh --exe ~/.local/bin/code-server
```

* You can install an old version of extension (say 0.0.1), with `--force 0.0.1` flag.

## 5. Reload the IDE

You need to reload the VS Code to activate the extension. Either simply restart
the IDE, or open the command palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Developer: Reload
Window".

## Updating

Run the install script again as written in [Install the extension](#4_install-the-extension).
You need to [reload the IDE](#5_reload-the-ide) after that.

# Features

### Code Completion and Navigation

Code completion in C++ is available in platform2 packages which support
`USE=compilation_database`. Press F12 to [Go to Definition], Ctrl+F12 to
Go to Implementation, and so on.

[Go to Definition]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/editingevolved#_go-to-definition

### Linter Integration

CrOS IDE exposes lint errors found by `cros lint` and similar tools in C++,
Python, shell, and GN files. We run linters every time a file is saved,
and mark errors with squiggly lines in the editor and show them in
the *Problems* box and on mouse hover. This feature bring to your attention
errors which block `repo upload`.

### Boards and Packages

CrOS IDE shows which packages you are working on and lets you run
`cros_workon start/stop` directly from the UI. Access it by clicking on
*CrOS Development* [activity bar]. Use +/– buttons to start and stop working
on packages.

### Code Search

You can easily open the current file in Code Search from the context menu in
a text editor. Go to [settings] to choose whether to chose which instance
to use (public, internal, or Gitiles).

# Known issues

* C++ code completion runs  `USE=compilation_database emerge-$BOARD $PKG`
  in the background and overrides existing files in `/build/$BOARD/`. For
  example, if you generate coverage with `USE=coverage cros_run_unit_tests ...`,
  CrOS IDE will override the coverage data.
