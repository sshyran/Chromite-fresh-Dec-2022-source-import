# CrOS IDE quickstart (go/cros-ide-quickstart)

CrOS IDE is a VSCode Extension for ChromiumOS development. It is a new project
and we currently support only internal developers at Google.

## Prerequisites

You need a ChromiumOS chroot. If you are a new member and don't have it, please
follow the [ChromiumOS Developer Guide] and set up your development environment,
so you can [enter the chroot via cros_sdk].

You also need `npm` and gsutil authentication, because the install script needs them.

- Follow http://go/nodejs/installing-node to install npm.
- Follow [Configure authentication (.boto)] to set up the `~/.boto` file.

In this document, we assume ChromiumOS source code is in `~/chromiumos`.

## 1. Install Visual Studio Code

First, you need to install Visual Studio Code (VSCode) on your client machine.

### gLinux

Check if it's already installed by running `code` in terminal
or look for it in the application menu, otherwise:

```
(cd &&
    sudo glinux-add-repo typescript stable &&
    sudo apt update &&
    sudo apt install code)
```

Learn more at [go/vscode/install#glinux]

[go/vscode/install#glinux]: http://go/vscode/install#glinux

### gMac

Install [VSCode from the Software Center] or [go/mule]
(`sudo mule install visual-studio-code`).

### ChromeOS

CrOS IDE supports only platform-specific VSCode, which is not available for
ChromeOS. There are two workarounds:

- Check out [go/cros-ide-on-chromebooks] to learn more about
  [Code Server], which is a Web IDE accessible in the browser.
- Use Chrome Remote Desktop.

[go/cros-ide-on-chromebooks]: http://go/cros-ide-on-chromebooks
[code server]: https://github.com/coder/code-server

## 2. (Optional) Connect to your machine via VSCode

If you use remote setup, for example gMac laptop, you will need [Remote development] extension.

Install [Remote development] extension on the VSCode.
Click the lower left "Open a Remote Window" button and select \[Connect to
Host...\] command (alternatively directly choose this command from the command
palette), select your remote machine, and open your working directory under `~/chromiumos/`.

## 3. Install the extension

From your terminal run

```
~/chromiumos/chromite/ide_tooling/cros-ide/install.sh
```

### Additional installation options

- In case you are using code-server or VSCode Insiders, specify the VSCode executable with
  `--exe` flag. For example

```
~/chromiumos/chromite/ide_tooling/cros-ide/install.sh --exe ~/.local/bin/code-server
```

- You can install an old version of the extension (say 0.0.1), with the `--force 0.0.1` flag.

## 4. Open or reload VSCode

Open VSCode, or reload it by either simply restarting it or opening the command
palette (Ctrl+Shift+P) and type "Developer: Reload Window".

## 5. Open a folder

Finally, open a folder with sources to let CrOS IDE detect the chroot.
Select _File &rarr; Open Folder..._, choose, for example, `~/chromiumos/src/platform2`,
and you are good to go.

## Using CrOS IDE

Check out [go/cros-ide-user-guide] to learn more about features, known issues,
and useful tips.

### Updating

Run the install script again as written in [Install the
extension](#3_install-the-extension) and [open or reload VSCode](#4_open-or-reload-vscode).

# Selected Features

### Code Completion and Navigation

Code completion in C++ is available in platform2 packages which support
`USE=compdb_only`. Press F12 to [Go to Definition], Ctrl+F12 to
Go to Implementation, and so on.

### Device Management

CrOS IDE provides a view to manage your test devices. With the built-in VNC
client, you can control a device remotely.

### Linter Integration

CrOS IDE exposes lint errors found by `cros lint` and similar tools in C++,
Python, shell, and GN files. We run linters every time a file is saved,
and mark errors with squiggly lines in the editor and show them in
the _Problems_ box and on mouse hover. This feature brings to your attention
errors which block `repo upload`.

### Boards and Packages

CrOS IDE shows which packages you are working on and lets you run
`cros_workon start/stop` directly from the UI. Access it by clicking on
_CrOS Development_ [activity bar]. Use +/â€“ buttons to start and stop working
on packages.

### Code Search

You can easily open the current file in Code Search from the context menu in
a text editor. Go to [settings] to choose whether to chose which instance
to use (public, internal, or Gitiles).
