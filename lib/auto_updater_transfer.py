"""Library containing functions to transfer files onto a remote device.

Transfer Base class includes:

  ----Tranfer----
  * @retry functionality for all public transfer functions.

LocalTransfer includes:

  ----Precheck---
  * Pre-check payload's existence before auto-update.

  ----Tranfer----
  * Transfer update-utils (nebraska, et. al.) package at first.
  * Transfer rootfs update files if rootfs update is required.
  * Transfer stateful update files if stateful update is required.

LabEndToEndPayloadTransfer includes:

  ----Precheck---
  * Pre-check payload's existence on the staging server before auto-update.

  ----Tranfer----
  * Download the update-utils (nebraska, et. al.) package onto the DUT directly
    from the staging server at first.
  * Download rootfs update files onto the DUT directly from the staging server
    if rootfs update is required.
  * Download stateful update files onto the DUT directly from the staging server
    if stateful update is required.
