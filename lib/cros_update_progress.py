"""A progress class for tracking CrOS auto-update process.

This class is mainly designed for:
  1. Set the pattern for generating the filenames of
     track_status_file/execute_log_file.
     track_status_file: Used for record the current step of CrOS auto-update
                        process. Only has one line.
     execute_log_file: Used for record the whole logging info of the CrOS
                       auto-update process, including any debug information.
  2. Write current auto-update process into the track_status_file.
  3. Read current auto-update process from the track_status_file.

This file also offers external functions that are related to add/check/delete
the progress of the CrOS auto-update process.
