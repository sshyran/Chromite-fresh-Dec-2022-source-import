  """Returns a map from each package to the source paths it depends on.

  A source path is considered dependency of a package if modifying files in that
  path might change the content of the resulting package.

  Notes:
    1) This method errs on the side of returning unneeded dependent paths.
       i.e: for a given package X, some of its dependency source paths may
       contain files which doesn't affect the content of X.

       On the other hand, any missing dependency source paths for package X is
       considered a bug.
    2) This only outputs the direct dependency source paths for a given package
       and does not takes include the dependency source paths of dependency
       packages.
       e.g: if package A depends on B (DEPEND=B), then results of computing
       dependency source paths of A doesn't include dependency source paths
       of B.

  Args:
    packages: The list of packages CPV names (str)
    sysroot_path: The path to the sysroot. Optional if |board| set and using
      default sysroot. If the packages are board agnostic, you can set |sdk|
      instead. Must not be set when using |sdk|.
    board: The name of the board. Optional if |sysroot| is set and in the
      default location. If the packages are board agnostic, you can set |sdk|
      instead. Must not be set when using |sdk|.
    sdk: Use the SDK's overlays instead of a board's overlays to find packages.
      This is effectively the set of shared, public overlays.

  Returns:
    Map from each package to the source path (relative to the repo checkout
      root, i.e: ~/trunk/ in your cros_sdk) it depends on.
    For each source path which is a directory, the string is ended with a
      trailing '/'.
