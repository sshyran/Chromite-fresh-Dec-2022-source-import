"""Provides utility for formatting repo manifests.

There does not seem to be any good off-the-shelf XML formatters.

The format we enforce:
* 2 space indents
* All elements start on new lines
* One attribute per line for most elements
* Attributes are indented & aligned to the first one
* Attributes are kept in a consistent order
* Use <foo/> closing syntax when element has no child elements
* Space before the closing />
* No space before the closing >
* Groups of <project> nodes are sorted by checkout path
* Single space between element name and attributes
* Comments have spaces around the <!-- and --> markers
* Comments are indented to the end of the <!-- marker
* Non-whitespace text nodes are deleted

See the files in our manifest repos for living examples.
